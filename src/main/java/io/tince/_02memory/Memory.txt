# Memory
4 Key Terms

- Bit
    - Short for binary digit, a bit is fundamental unit of information in Computer Science that represents a state with one of two values, typically 0 and 1.
    - Any data stored in computer is, at the most basic level, represented in bits.

- Byte
    - A group of eight bits. For example, 01101000 is a byte.
    - Single byte can represent up to 256 data values (2^8).
    - Since a binary number is expressed with only two symbols, like 0 and 1, a byte can effectively represent all off the numbers between 0 and 255,
    inclusive, in binary format.

- Fixed-Width Integer
    - An integer represented by a fixed amount of "bits". For example, 1 32-bit integer is an integer represented by 32bits (4bytes),
    and a 64-bit integer is an integer represented by 64 bits(8 bytes).
    - Regardless of how large an integer is, its fixed-width-integer representation is, by definition, made up of a constant number of bits.
    - It follows that, regardless of how large an integer is, an operation performed on its fixed-width-integer representation consist
    of a constant number of bit manipulations, since the integer is made up of a fixed number of bits.

- Memory
    - Broadly speaking, memory is the foundational layer of computing, where all data is stored.
    - In the context of coding interviews, it's important to note the following points:
        * Data stored in memory is stored in bytes and, by extension, bits.
        * Bytes in memory can "point" to other bytes in memory, so to store references to other data.
        * The amount of memory that a machine has is bounded, making it valuable to limit how much memory an algorithm takes up.
        * Accessing a byte or a fixed number of bytes (like 4 bytes or 8 bytes in the case of 32-bit and 645-bit integers) is
        an elementary operation, which can be loosely treated as a single unit of operational work.
