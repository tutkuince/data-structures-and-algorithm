/**
 * Array: Max Profit
 *
 * You are tasked with implementing a method, "maxProfit" that takes an array of integers representing the price of a given stock on different days.
 *
 * The method should determine the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling the stock once. Note that you must buy before you can sell.
 *
 * Method Signature: public static int maxProfit(int[] prices)
 *
 * Input: An array of integers "prices" where each element in the array is an integer representing the price of the stock for a specific day,
 * and where the element's index corresponds to the day number.
 *
 * Output: Returns an integer that is the maximum profit possible. If no profit can be made, the method should return 0.
