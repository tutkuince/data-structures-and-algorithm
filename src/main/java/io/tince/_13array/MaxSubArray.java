/**
 * Array: Max Sub Array
 *
 * You have been asked to create a method in Java, maxSubarray, that finds the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number)
 * which has the largest sum and returns its sum.
 *
 * Method Signature: public static int maxSubarray(int[] nums)
 *
 * This method takes as input an array of integers "nums" and returns an integer representing the maximum of a contiguous subarray within the input array.
 *
 * Note
 *  - A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. In other words, a subarray is a sequence of elements that are in direct succession in the array,
 *  with no elements from the array skipped or interspersed.
 *  - You need to find a contiguous subarray with the largest sum. This subarray could be the entire array,
 *  or it could be a smaller part of the array. It could include negative numbers, but the sum of the subarray must be maximized.
 *  - You can assume that the input array is non-empty and contains at least one number.
 * */
