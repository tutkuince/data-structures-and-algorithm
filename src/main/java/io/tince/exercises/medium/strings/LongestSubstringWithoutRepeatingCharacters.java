/**
 * Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
 * <p>
 * Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "abcabcbb"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
 * <p>
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "bbbbb"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
 * <p>
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "pwwkew"
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
 * Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
