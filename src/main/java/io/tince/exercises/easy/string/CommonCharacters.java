 * Common Characters
 *
 * Write a function that takes in a non-empty list of non-empty strings and returns a list of characters that are common to all strings in the list,
 * ignoring multiplicity.
 *
 * Note that the strings are not guaranteed to only contain alphanumeric characters. The list you return can be in any order.
 *
 * Sample Input: strings = ["abc", "bcd", "cbaccd"]
 * Sample Output: ["b", "c"]    // the characters could be ordered differently.
