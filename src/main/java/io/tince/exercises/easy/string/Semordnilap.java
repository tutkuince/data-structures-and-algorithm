/**
 * Semordnilap
 * <p>
 * Write a function that takes in a list of uniques strings and returns a list of semordnilap pairs.
 * <p>
 * A semordnilap pair is defined as a set of different strings where the reverse of one word is the same as the forward version of the order.
 * For example the words "diaper" and "repaid" are a semordnilap pair, as are the words "palindromes" and "semordnilap".
 * <p>
 * The order of the returned pairs and the order of the strings within each pair does not matter.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input: words = ["diaper", "abc", "test", "cba", "repaid"]
 * Sample Output: [["diaper", "repaid"], ["abc", "cba"]]
