/**
 * First Non-Repeating Character
 * <p>
 * Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.
 * <p>
 * The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that occurs only once.
 * If the input string does not have any non-repeating characters, your function should return -1.
 * <p>
 * Sample Input: "abcdcaf"
 * Sample Output: 1 -> The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.
