# Logarithm

A mathematical concept that's widely used in Computer Science and that's defined by the following equation:

logb(x) = y if and only if by = x

In the context of coding interviews, the logarithm is used to describe the complexity analysis of algorithms,
and its usage always implies a logarithm of base 2. In other words, the logarithm used in the context of coding interviews is defined by the following equation:

log(n) = y if and only if 2y = n

In plain English, if an algorithm has a logarithmic time complexity (O(log(n)), where n is the size of the input),
then whenever the algorithm's input doubles in size (i.e., whenever n doubles), the number of operations needed
to complete the algorithm only increases by one unit. Conversely, an algorithm with a linear time complexity would see its number of operations double
if its input size doubled.

As an example, a linear-time-complexity algorithm with an input of size 1,000 might take roughly 1,000 operations to complete,
whereas a logarithmic-time-complexity algorithm with the same input would take roughly 10 operations to complete, since 210 ~= 1,000.
