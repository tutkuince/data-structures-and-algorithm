# Complexity Analysis
3 Key Terms
- Complexity Analysis
    - The process of determining how efficient an algorithm is. Complexity analysis usually involves finding both
    the "time complexity" and the "space complexity" of an algorithm.
    - Complexity analysis is effectively used to determine how "good" an algorithm is and whether it's "better" than another one.

- Time complexity
    - A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interviews.
    - It's expressed using "Big O" notation

- Space Complexity
    - A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithms and in coding interview
    - It's expressed using "Big O" notation.
