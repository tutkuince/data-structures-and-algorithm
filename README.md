# Data Structures & Algorithms + Exercises
## Linked Lists
### LinkedList vs ArrayList
#### ArrayList
- An ArrayList is a dynamic array-based data structure in Java that can grow or shrink in size dynamically.
- It's part of the Java Collections Framework and allows you to store and manipulate a list of elements, providing methods for adding, removing, and accessing elements.
- Unlike traditional arrays, ArrayLists automatically handle resizing, making them more flexible for many programming tasks.
#### LinkedList
- A LinkedList is a data structure in which elements are connected through pointers or references.
- It consists of nodes, each containing data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
- There are singly linked lists (each node points to the next) and doubly linked lists (nodes have references to both the next and previous nodes).
- LinkedLists are efficient for insertions and deletions in the middle but less efficient for random access.

The main differences between ArrayList and LinkedList in Java are:
- Internal Structure:
  - ArrayList uses an array to store elements.
  - LinkedList uses a doubly linked list structure with nodes containing data and references to the next and previous nodes.
- Access Time:
  - ArrayList provides faster random access time due to direct array indexing.
  - LinkedList is slower for random access but efficient for insertions and deletions in the middle.
- Insertions and Deletions:
  - ArrayList is less efficient for insertions and deletions in the middle because elements need to be shifted.
  - LinkedList excels in insertions and deletions at any position due to its structure.
- Memory Usage:
  - ArrayList may have slightly less memory overhead due to its simple array structure.
  - LinkedList has more memory overhead because of the additional node references.
- Iterating Through Elements:
  - ArrayList is faster when iterating sequentially through elements.
  - LinkedList is slower due to the need to follow node references.
- Implementation:
  - ArrayList is a more straightforward implementation.
  - LinkedList involves more complex pointer manipulation.
 
The choice between ArrayList and LinkedList depends on your specific use case. 
- If you need fast random access and are not frequently inserting or removing elements in the middle, ArrayList is a better choice.
- If you require efficient insertions and deletions or are working with large datasets, LinkedList may be more suitable.
